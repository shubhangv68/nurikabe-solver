Board Generators

## `puzzleMaker.py`

This tool generates puzzle boards

To create a board, run the `puzzleMaker.py` file.

You will be prompted to enter the size of the board(s). You can enter a single size or a range of sizes. For example: 14, 7, 8, 5-9, 12-17, or 8-13 are all valid board sizes

Progress bars will show the status of the board creation process.

Once the program finishes, a file named `boards.json` will be created within the same directory containing the output.

## `DatabaseMaker.py`

Meant to be run once

to create the database, run the file

You will be prompted to confirm if you are sure you want to run it, if you do type 'y' and it'll start the creation process

it will take a while (not the most efficient code but it works)
